                        <p class="text-muted">In 1991 we had a way for us to share documents. HTML is a way for us to just write text on website and these texts on websites can also have things called hypelinks that can link to other parts of the website. In 1995 and 1996 two technologies came into being - CSS and JavaScript. CSS solved the problem of to have some visual aspects, so we can toy around with website and make it look pretty. With JavaScript you can have interactivity, drop-down menus to make websites interactive. In Developer tools section "Elements" belongs to HTML, section "Styles" belongs to CSS and "Console" belongs to JavaScript.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">It is really important to understand what means being a Web Developer, what problems they had in the past, how they found solutions to those problems and where they are at now. The Internet started off with the ARPANET in 1969 basically a military project and connected a few universities such as UTAH, UCLA and throughout the 70s, the 80s it kept growing. Despite that there was a problem essentially for the academics, they needed a way to share documents. Up until the World Wide Web exists the Internet was there but it was really really hard for computers to communicate with each other to share academic papers. In 1989 first Web Developer Tim Berners-Lee working at CERN invented the World Wide Web. World Wide Web (www) is common language that computers can speak, communicate together, share images, share files to each other. The servers, the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the browers all work on top of the World Wide Web. He created the first browser, the first server and also the very first website ever - info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html . With the help of that he created ability for people to communicate and link to other documents so that we have this growing knowledge base of the world.</p>

                        <h4 class="my-3 pt-5">Keyboard Shortcuts & Extensions</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">The keyboard shortcuts, extensions are incredibly useful because they will make your life much easier and will save you tons of time over your career as a programmer. Here are some of the keyboard shortcuts that I'm doing almost every time when I code.
                           <br> 1. Ctrl + C - to copy selected text <br>
                            2. Ctrl + X - to cut selected text <br>
                            3. Ctrl + V - to paste the copied text <br>
                            4. Ctrl + A - to select all text <br>
                            5. Ctrl + Enter - to create a new line below the current line <br>
                            6. Shift + Alt + Pg Dn arrow - to duplicate the line right down below. For example, you can press "Pg Dn arrow" button 5 times and it will duplicate the line 5 times below the current line. <br>
                            7. Ctrl + Z - to undo <br>
                            8. Ctrl + Y - to redo <br>
                            9. Ctrl + L - to select current line <br>
                            10. Ctrl + Shift + K - to delete line <br>
                            Also, I installed some extensions for Visual Studio Code:
                            1.  Prettier - makes your code more readable and consistent with your project's style guide.
                            2. Live Server - Makes your existing server live - this is a Web Extension that helps you to live reload feature for dynamic content
                            3. Auto Rename Tag - For example, let's say you want to rename an existing opening tag this extension will automatically rename the closing tag for you.
                            4. Material Icon Theme - Design icons for your files.</p>

                        <h4 class="my-3 pt-5">ASCII and UTF-8</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Character encoding standards ASCII and UTF-8 which is the most prevalent encoding of Unicode as sequences of bytes invented by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike in 1992. Unicode (UTF-8) supports almost all possible characters, including international characters. It can represent any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. For example, users who need to send an e-mail with non-Latin data (e.g., the Euro symbol, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, etc.) should use this encoding. It is the preferred and most used encoding. For instance, if youâ€™re sending any entirely non-ASCII messages (Asian languages, primarily) then UTF-8 is your best bet.</p>

                        <h4 class="my-3 pt-5">FTP</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, it's a communication protocol that is used to transfer files from one computer to another, with one functioning as the server, as long as both computers have an Internet connection. There are couple of ways to transfer files using FTP. You can do this using a basic internet browser or an FTP Client such as FileZilla. Unfortunately, this is not a secure protocol because the data that's being exchanged is not encrypted, which might cause security concerns. Also, there are two other protocols for data transferring: SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol and TFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol.</p>

                        </span>
                        <h4 class="my-3 pt-5">React</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">React is a front-end JavaScript library for creating user interfaces or UI components that is free and open-source. It is run by Facebook and a community of independent developers and businesses. React can be used to build single-page or mobile apps. Although React is not a comprehensive framework, this has never stopped it from being popular. Companies have been employing React engineers to work on their apps. In 2020, it would undoubtedly be one of the greatest JavaScript frameworks. It includes Concurrent Mode and the Suspense concept, which allow developers to create more feature-rich apps. The concurrent mode would allow the program to focus on things that are more important, such as communicating with users and their inputs. Suspension mode, on the other hand, allows data retrieval when needed while suspending it when not. These two modes, when combined, will keep developers engaged to React and allowing them to do new things with their app development.</p>
