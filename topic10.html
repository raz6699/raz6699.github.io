                       <br><br>   <strong>  Changing trends </strong>
                            <br>  Consumers are shifting their spending from in-store to online making an e-commerce presence critical for businesses to stay afloat. Many businesses are relying on platforms like cloaud-based Shopify, which has jumped 73% since the WHO declared a pandemic in mid-March. Shopify powers sites for 1 milion businesses worldwide (175 Countries), including Allbirds, Staples and PepsiCo (1M Customers) and has some big plans for its own business, possibly to rival with Amazon. Market Cap - $83.6B
                            
                           <br> Olli Finkelstein, Shopify chief operating officer, thinks that there are couple of things that people haven't fully appreciated about ecommerce:
                            
                            The year 2030 in terms of what retail and commerce would look like in 2030 has been pulled into 2020. In his opinion this happens in two ways: On the supply side we have a tale of two completely different retail worlds - archaic retailers that have been resisting change that viewed multi-channel as a strategy (which it's not a tactic) and on the other side we have resilient retailers. Some of these companies are new to the market and are very quickly pivoted, adapted and they're succeeding now. <br> Also there are companies like Lint and Heinz ketchup that are using Shopify and in a metter of a couple days completely change their business model to go direct to consumer. On the other side we have demand because consumers want to buy from independent brands. Ecommerce as a percentage of total retail it took about eight years to from five percent to fifteen percent and it's taken ten weeks to go from 15% to 25%. So we have this incredible catalyzing of retail and commerce and those that are adapting are doing really great, and those that aren't, unfortunate being left behind. The Strategy per Olli Finkelstein is to sell everywhere where your consumers are (online, offline or on Facebook or Instagram or on marketplaces etc.) and not multi-channel strategy. <br>  He also talked about partnership with Facebook saying that they have been working with Facebook for over five years now and in fact as soon as they started thinking about commerce and retail Shopify have been a part of those conversations and have been their partner on it. <br> He also notes that Shopify is not a just neat commerce provider, they are reatil operating system and their job is to enable brands to sell anywhere where they have consumers wheater is online, offline, Facebook, Instagram or on marketplaces. But it all feeds back in one centralized office or retail operating system and that sort of more places that connect merchants and brands can sell, the more they make, the more complexity there is and the more value Shopify provides them. Looking in the future Shopify chief operating officer said that Shopify is thinking about new area called merchants solutions: <br> They started with payments by creating Shopify payments, created Shopify Capital - given out about a bilion dollars of capital to small businesses. <br> Another thing SHopify wants to do is to give opportunity any big and small businesses to do two-day affordable shipping eventually everywhere in the world.</p>
