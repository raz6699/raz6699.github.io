                           <br> WordPress is an open source CMS which means anyone can add to the community. There are thousands of themes and plugins provided by third-party developers. This wide selection makes WordPress much more customizable than Squarespace but it also means WordPress often has a steeper learning curve. So at a high level Squarespace is intuitive and user friendly but less flexible. WordPress has a steeper learning curve but it's more flexible. One important difference between WordPress and Squarespace is the page editor Squarespace uses a visual page editor which lets you drag and drop content blocks up and down the page and into columns so It's simple and intuitive WordPress recently switched to a new page editor called Gutenberg. Gutenberg allows you to drag and drop elements up and down the page. However, unlike Squarespace, Gutenberg is abstracted away from your website so it doesn't show you how the page looks within the context of your website. This means you'll often find yourself flipping from Gutenberg to the website preview in order to accurately see how things are looking. Overall Squarespace is editor is more intuitive and easier to use. The interface feels polished and thoughtful. An ideal example of this is photo cropping in order to display a photo gallery as a perfect grid most photos need to be cropped. the Squarespace has this simple built-in system for adjusting crop. WordPress, on the other hand, is often more overwhelming. the editor can feel cluttered and occasionally chaotic. But this isn't because WordPress doesn't care about ease of use, instead it's actually more fundamental. WordPress is just designed to be more flexible so the interface needs to be more abstract. WordPress's open source which means anyone can contribute to it. This is both a strength and a weakness. The strength is that there is a huge amount of themes and plugins. There is eleven thousand themes on theme forest and fifty thousand plugins on wordpress.org. The weakness is that many themes and plugins don't work perfectly out of the box. Incompatibilities often arise and getting the fix can require you to tweak code. All you have to do is browse plug-in reviews to find users running into these kind of problems but if you can live with the occasional incompatibility error you'll love that you can find a WordPress plugin for just about anything. Some plugins are even quite Sophisticated. For example WooCommerce is an e-commerce plugin that's totally fully featured. Squarespace is not open-source and developers can't simply choose to create a plug-in for Squarespace. Instead Squarespace curates a selection of 60 partners like Instagram, acuity scheduling, Apple News, Zapier and more. Squarespace will never match the amount of plugins and themes available on WordPress but the upside is that everything on Squarespace just works. You don't have to troubleshoot incompatibilities or worry that your theme doesn't support a plug-in. If Squarespace supports an integration you can be confident that it was integrated thoroughly. Use Squarespace if you're building a conventional website, and use WordPress if you need an unconventional feature for your website. Photography, portfolios, blogs, and small business websites these are all examples of conventional websites. WordPress has BuddyPress, a plugin that adds a social network to your website and that's an example of an unconventional feature. There are so many unconventional WordPress plugins:
                            
                          <br><br><strong> 1. </strong> Content randomizer - it let’s you create random content blocks. For example, if you wanted your sidebar to randomly cycle through a collection of quotes and jokes.
                          <br><br><strong> 2. </strong> Redirection is a 301 redirect manager.
                          <br><br><strong> 3. </strong> Visual link preview creates Facebook like previews of links
                          <br><br><strong> 4. </strong> Table press lets you create tables in a spreadsheet style interface. There are roughly 70 Squarespace themes in over 11,000 WordPress themes but just like with features WordPress wins and shares selection while Squarespace is best if you just want a beautiful theme that works out of the box. In fact Squarespace have the best themes of any website builder they all have a definite look and feel they're clean and sophisticated with bold typography and plenty of space for photography. By contrast WordPress has 11,000 themes available and some are great while others are more outdated. You'll also occasionally run into WordPress theme compatibility issues which are usually fixed by tweaking CSS code WordPress themes can be totally customized so long as you're willing to code or hide our developer otherwise Squarespace actually has better theme customization with their style editor. Squarespace is style editor is both powerful and intuitive. You can easily customize hundreds of style options just drill down to specific style options by clicking the elements in the website preview. The WordPress style editor is called customizer and it mostly feels like a watered down version of Squarespace’s style editor. You have to pay for both Squarespace and WordPress but you will pay in different ways: Squarespace offers for all-inclusive plans which range from $12 to $40 per month. The more expensive plans are for e-commerce. WordPress is free to use but you have to host it somewhere and a decent entry-level house such as SiteGround will cost around the same as a Squarespace website plan. There are free WordPress themes available but often the best themes are for sale. You can expect to pay between $39 to $120 for a premium WordPress theme but you only pay that once and you get the rights to that theme for life. There are also many free WordPress plugins but the best plugins again are often for sale. For example WP forms costs $40 per year. Differences in customer support: Squarespace provides 24/7 email support and a live chat service during Eastern Standard Time working hours. Because WordPress is an open-source platform it doesn't come with any customer support though many paid themes and plugins include some customer support from the Creator. Also some specialized web hosts will help you install and set up a WordPress website. In the nutshell, both WordPress and Squarespace have strengths and weaknesses. Squarespace is a complete package that is intuitive and thoughtful and everything just works, but Squarespace will never be able to match the amount of features and flexibility that WordPress offers. As a recommendation, you can use Squarespace for conventional websites and WordPress for websites that need unconventional features.</p>
