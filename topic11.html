                            To become a Web Developer the very first thing is to start with the basic fundamentals. When it comes to the basic fundamentals the biggest thing is to understand that The Internet is all just a bunch of wires that are connecting everyone around the world with Internet and the way we view web pages: browser sends a request to a computer somewhere in the world called a server, asked for some data information and the way it sends this data is through a protocol called HTTP or HTTPS and usually sends 3 files: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The job of a Web Developer is to write these files, so that we can display information to the user. The first step is to learn about Editor/IDE. These are text editors and developer environments that allow us to write code. For example the most popular ones are Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text. Next step is to know about Git and Github: it's a way for programmers to save code online and essentially have a social profile of all the code that they've written.

                            <br>  <br> 3. Terminal/Powershell/Command Prompt: Terminal also called command line is simply a way for you to communicate with your computer without using a mouse, it's a text-based way to work with your computer. It also allows you to do a lot of important things as a programmer for example git and github with the way you use git is through something like a terminal, Windows users use something like Powershell or command prompt also it has terminal or we can do WSL2 which is Windows subsystem for Linux to run Linux like commands.

                             <br><br> 4. Domain Name Servers like GoDaddy or Namecheap allow you to buy a domain name. With a DNS server we want to say where is this computer in the world so we can get JavaScript, HTML and CSS files to the browser. For example we can ran a command on terminal called ping google.com and it gives us a number 172.217.1.174 which is called IP address and when we paste and search that number it will take us to google.com. DNS server says hey this number points to a computer somewhere in the world and figure out what name is associated with this number.

                             <br><br> 5. FTP/SFTP or File Transfer Protocol with a help of this we can transfer our files of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to a server somewhere in the world. For example Cyberduck for Mac or FileZilla for Windows.

                            <br><br>  6. HTTP/HTTPS is essentially the way that browsers communicate with servers. HTTPS S stands for secure which means that this communication with a server is secure so we can for example submit passwords or user information over Internet cables and it'll be secure.

                            <br><br>   7. JSON/XML/gRPC - it's the way that we transfer data from server to clients. JSON: {"id":42} ; XML: 42 ; gRPC technically uses protobufs sends data like this: 0x08 0x2a.

                            <br><br>   8. SSH is really really important for us as a Web Developer mainly for working with github. For example if you go to github to one of your repositories you can usually clone the code using SSH or HTTPS. Also we can use SSH to actually log in to a server somewhere or a computer somewhere.

                             <br><br>  9. Web APIs are essentially tools that browsers give us.

                             <br>  1. Dom stands for document object model allows us to use JavaScript to modify different things around the page.
                              <br> 2. Fetch/XHR allows us to fetch or retrieve data from other websites.
                              <br>3. Local Storage to save user information.
                             <br>  4. Service Workers allows you to do some interesting thing called caching and also allows us to do progressive web apps.
                            <br>  5. i18n - internationalization so that websites can display different languages.
                            <br><br>    Front End is what the user sees, a web app, a web page is worked on by front-end developers (JavaScript developers, React Angular View Developers).

                              <br> 1. To become Front End Developer first you want to learn about HTML specifically HTML5 which is latest specification. It's a file that displays text. It was the initial way that web started just with HTML files that allowed universities to communicate and share text with each other. There are a lot of things we can do with HTML, for example forms and submitting forms like username and passwords. Using tags we can describe what our web page should display (hyperlink, paragraph, title, etc.).
                              <br> 2. Semantic HTML: this literally means how can we describe our HTML file the best for example using article tag to say this section has an article or address tag to say this section has an address and so on.
                               <br> 3. SEO - Search Engine Optimization: essentially HTML tags and the text that are within them allow places like Google to rank your websites. HTML has a big impact on SEO.
                               <br> 4. Accessibility: that is how can we make web pages and web apps accesible to everybody. Not everybody maybe can view websites and they need a visual aid or they need a screen reader to understand what a website does. It's a very important for us to consider everybody when building web apps and web pages.
                               <br> 5. HTML forms is a really important part pf the web and there's a lot we can do with it before we even introduce JavaScript.
                              <br><br>  CSS or CSS3 which is the latest specification is what style does your web app or web page should have, it makes websites look nice. The important things to keep in mind especially for modern websites are these 4 things: Animations, CSS Variables, rem vs em vs px and Media Queries.

                             <br>  1. You can do animations with CSS.
                              <br> 2. CSS variables allow us to do something cool like dark and white theme on websites just using variables.
                              <br> 3. Rem vs em vs px - this allows you to define the size of an element on a page. For example using rem which is a relative size so that our websites become more responsive and moblie-friendly if we just use pixels. It's recommended to start using rem for example for font sizes.
                             <br>  4. Media Queries allow our websites to be displayed on different screens, because modern web apps needs to be responsive.
                             <br><br>   CSS layout is all about where should we position elements or components on our websites. Using Flexbox or CSS Grid tools we can pretty much do any sort of layout that we want. Using these two properly we actually might not even need to use media queries. Next important part is Box Model how margins and padding work to make those minor adjustments.

                             <br>  1. Positioning, Display, floats these are ways to display and position elements.
                             <br> 2. Bootstrap (or 3rd party Libraries) allowed us to do layouts really easy before we have things like Flexbox and CSS Grid.
                             <br> 3. Preprocessors are essentially ways for us to write a souped-up or a superset of CSS that allows us to have extra features and then they get preprocessed into regular CSS. There are three of them: PostCSS, Less but the most popular one is Sass.
                             <br><br>   Organizing CSS - as projects get bigger and bigger it becomes harder manage and a lot of these tools help us not to build really small tiny one-page websites, they helped us build really big web apps like Facebook that have so many features. For example SMACSS, OOCSS, BEM, ATOMIC CSS.

                           <br><br>     CSS in JS way of organizing styles is a more modern way that was introduced with React. Instead of writting CSS the regular way let's just write it inside of JavaScript and then whatever tool or library we'll use to apply those styles automaticaly. Facebook that pioneered the CSS in JS mentality has its own implementation, CSS Modules, Styled-components that's really popular with react projects and also Emotions.

                          <br><br>      Frameworks/Libraries are infinite there's so many you can create a library, you can create framework. Essentially they are helpers instead of all of us all developers, all designers writting CSS from scratch, we can share some things. It's a way for us to use tools that are already pre-built for us. When it comes to CSS we have things like Foundation, Materialize CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma and Tailwind CSS/UI which is a popular one this days.
