                           <br> <strong> 1. SEO in a Nutshell </strong>
                           <br> SEO is an abbreviation for search engine optimization, which is a digital marketing technique that focuses on your website's visibility in search results on search engines such as Google. When you understand how SEO works, you can employ a variety of strategies to improve your visibility (or rank) in search results.

                          <strong>  2. Google's Top Ranking Factors </strong>
                           <br> 1) Relevance (Does the post thoroughly cover exactly what the user was searching?)
                            
                           <br> 2) Quality backlinks and internal links
                            
                            <br> 3) User experience (CTR, time on page)
                            
                           <br> 4) E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
                            
                          <br> 5) Use of Images
                            
                          <br> 6) Outbound links
                            
                          <br> 7) Content age
                            
                          <br> 8) Social signals
                            
                          <br> 9) Site structure
                            
                      <br><br> <strong> 3. Being Relevant on Google </strong>
                         <br>   Relevance is the number one ranking factor, which means that you have to write content that matches a search. The only reason people do this is because they have something they want to share, but also because that is the type of stuff we see all the time on social media, on YouTube, and it is the viral type of content that fails on Google search. Google search wants you to answer his or her inquiry, therefore you must consider what topic someone is entering into Google and then select what material you will develop that is the best answer to that question. Google doesn't care about keywords; it's all about semantics, or what the intent behind the search is; the words used in the search no longer matter. The second issue is that none of these tools have access to the same size of data set that Google has, not even close to a million of the data that Google has, and as a result, they're extrapolating from the data sets they're able to put together, and their numbers are typically very far off from reality, except for high volume searches, which are typically the type of searches.
                            
                           <br><br> <strong> 4. How to Find Relevant Search Terms </strong>
                           <br> 1) Enter a general relevant word or phrase into the search bar.
                            
                          <br> 2) Use Google's autocomplete function to see what queries have volume.
                            
                          <br> 3) Use every letter for multiple searches to widen your horizons.
                            
                          <br> 4) Try using an asterisk as a placeholder.
                            
                          <br> 5) Check out Google's "People Also Ask" in the results for inspiration.
                            
                          <br> 6) DON'T use paid keyword tools for this purpose.
                            
                          <br><br> <strong> 5. Mastering on-page SEO </strong>
                           <br> So on-page SEO simply means what you're actually putting out the content, you're actually putting on the website, and there's a lot to how you format and write that content to make it rank exactly, and one of the big factors that we've seen that people talk about a lot when it comes to on-page SEO is the length of the content. There's a bit of a correlation between the length of a blog post and how well it ranks. However, that correlation can lead you to make a significant error, which is to simply write longer and longer pieces. Instead, we've found that sizing the content length as well as the depth of the material to the search query works incredibly well. So we train our members to write three different types of posts: response posts, staple posts, and pillar posts. A response pulse is around 1250 words. A staple post is around 2200 words long, while a pillar post is approximately 350 words long. So we do this not because we believe that word count is directly a ranking signal, but rather because there are different buckets of different types of queries and in depth nasai t' so that you're hitting a good broadness of different types of searches that people make and also you're creating some content that's easy to produce and quick and others that's really meditative.
                            
                          <br><br> <strong> 6. Optimizing to Win The Snippet </strong>
                           <br> The snippet is the rich content that appears at the top of a search result. We're noticing that the number is changing more and more each month, with more and more searches containing some form of rich piece of material. The rich snippet extracts information from the blog post that particularly answers the query and then includes a link to the blog article that generated the snippet. In order to provide that bit of information, we are developing a small piece of material in each and every blog post that is designed to be the snippet. When we do this, our blog posts frequently win the snippet. So snippet optimization is like crickets in the industry, and it's so cool because you have to rank for so many different variables. Because your site is little, you must outperform the big guys in terms of links and everything else, but if you make the finest two sentence summary of this search and get Google to accept that as the snippet, you will leapfrog everyone to the top of the search because you had outstanding two sentences. it's a hundred percent organic and natural way of linking. If you're simply creating a better answer to the query, it's difficult for others to overcome, even if they're equally sized to you on the web. One small table has all of the information that would normally be found in a whole blog post, but it has been condensed into one short and incredibly convenient table. This formatting is a game changer in making your blog post extremely user friendly. That one thing is far more beneficial than a thousand words.</p>
