          To experience some of the most inspiring views America has to offer,
          plan a trip to Grand Canyon National Park. The Colorado River weaves
          its way through the 277-mile-long canyon, making it a top destination
          for whitewater rafting. The Arizona park is also a superb spot to
          hike, offering scenic paths like the Bright Angel and North Kaibab
          trails. Regardless of how you choose to spend your time in the Grand
          Canyon, you're sure to feel small against its towering rock formations
          and expansive vistas.<a

          A vacation at Yosemite National Park in California is all about
          reconnecting with nature. Spend your visit checking out famous
          landmarks like Half Dome and Glacier Point or hiking Cathedral Lakes,
          the Mist Trail and other popular paths. You'll also want to save time
          to admire Yosemite's numerous waterfalls, including towering Yosemite
          Falls, which is one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. If you're
          not one for camping, opt for a daytrip from San Francisco, Sacramento
          or Lake Tahoe.<a

          America's first national park provides more than 900 miles of hiking
          trails, as well as plenty of attractions to excite nature lovers, from
          steaming geysers to bubbling hot springs. Plus, animal fans will
          appreciate a visit to the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center to learn
          about local wildlife. If you'd rather look for wild critters inside
          the park – which occupies parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho – spend
          a few hours driving through the Hayden and Lamar valleys. Both areas
          are considered popular havens for Yellowstone National Park's resident
          bison, wolves and grizzly bears.<a

          With idyllic beaches and verdant parks, Maui offers ample
          opportunities to relax. Here, you can spend your days admiring the
          scenery as you cruise along the Road to Hana, fly above the Hawaiian
          island in a helicopter or lounge across the black sands of
          Waianapanapa State Park. If you'd rather cool off than sunbathe, sign
          up for a snorkeling tour. And for an unforgettable experience,
          previous visitors recommend making the trek to Haleakala Observatory
          to catch a sunrise or sunset. Sampling Maui's seafood is also a must,
          but don't overlook other island delicacies like haupia, a creamy
          coconut custard.<a

          Glaciers are the main draw of this Montana national park, but its more
          than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and multiple waterfalls are
          equally impressive. Hiking is the most popular pastime for visitors
          thanks to the park's mix of easy trails like Rocky Point and
          challenging routes, such as Grinnell Glacier and the Highline Trail.
          Additionally, the area is a prime spot for canoeing and fishing in
          summer, and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in winter. Plus, wild
          animals like moose, bears and elk are frequently spotted here.<a

          Known for its diverse cultural scene, the Big Apple boasts so many
          things to do that it puts most of its U.S. peers to shame. Whether you
          choose to spend the day perusing The Metropolitan Museum of Art's
          exhibits, catching a show on Broadway or trying the city's famous
          pizza, chances are you'll never find yourself feeling bored here. When
          you need some respite from the city's busy street life and soaring
          skyscrapers, retreat to scenic Central Park or the artsy High Line.<a
