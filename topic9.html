                        <p class="text-muted text-lg-start"><br> <strong> What is a payment gateway and how does it work? </strong>
                           <br> A payment gateway is a software application that payment service providers use to process payments for online purchases originating on a merchant's website. It acts as an interface between the merchant's website and a payment processing bank known as an acquirer. Online credit card payments: The gateway encrypts sensitive credit card details to ensure that information is passed securely between the customer, the merchant, and the acquiring bank. When a customer purchases a product or service on a website that is connected to a payment gateway, the gateway performs a variety of tasks to process the transaction. Once the customer places their order on the merchant's website, they choose to checkout or pay, and are then redirected to a payment page to enter their credit card details. If the merchant is fully compliant with the necessary security standards, the payment page can be generated on the merchant's servers and the cart information collected and passed on to the payment application in a secure way. The payment page can also be generated by the payment gateway application itself and information can be collected there. Either way, the card and transaction details are gathered and stored on the secure surface of the payment gateway. From there, the payment gateway processes the transaction and sends all information to the issuing bank for approval via the acquirer and the relevant card scheme. Once the payment has been confirmed by the card schemes, the payment gateway sends the approved transaction back to the merchant's website and then the merchant informs the customer that the purchase has been successfully completed. This entire process only takes around three seconds Payment gateways add a whole load of value throughout this process. Here are some of the key features: A payment gateway is the most common way for a merchant to connect to the payment system. Only the largest merchants are able to connect to an acquiring bank directly. Gateway transaction fees are very small compared to the advantages they offer in helping a merchant connect to an acquirer, manage their business and control the risks associated with accepting online payments. A good payment gateway will provide the merchant with many customizable reporting options, which help the merchant to manage their business. A good payment gateway will be connected and able to process many different payment methods that may not yet be offered by the merchant.
                            
                           <br><br> <strong> Top 10 payment gateways - detailed analysis </strong>
                           <br><br> <strong> 1. Stripe </strong>
                           <br> Stripe is one of the most industry standart paymant gateway loved by every single developer. This was the first paymant gateway that made everything so simplified. On the other hand there are couple of issues:
                            
                          <br> 1. Onboarding process is still not as easy as it should be
                            
                          <br> 2. The pricing are very competitive:  Domestic - 2%, 3% International - 4.3%.
                            
                            The reason why international pricing is expensive because they have a lot of fraud protection.
                            
                          <br> 3. documentation - best in the industry
                            
                          <br> 4. payment option side - lagging a little bit
                            
                         <br>  5. user interface - the best in the industry
                            
                          <br> 6. reporting - top-notch, althought the graphs and charts a little bit missing
                            
                         <br><br> <strong>  2. PayPal </strong>
                          <br> 1. onboarding process - a little bit painful
                           There are a lot of documentation that goes through and forth and sometimes either their staff is not well trained for the verification process.
                            
                           <br> 2. pricing is very competitve - 2%, 3%
                            
                         <br>  3. documentation - amazing
                            
                          <br> 4. payment option - lagging a little bit. It just gives you a card to pay the things, not much of the UPI and wallets.
                            
                          <br> 5. user interface - probably the worst
                            
                         <br> 6. reports - pretty okay 3/5 star
                            
                          <br><br> <strong> 3. Paytm </strong>

                           <br> 2. pricing - competitive. One of the issues that there is a limit of $20,000 for beginners to have credit and debit card.
                            
                          <br> 3. payment option - they provide you a lot of options for the payments, especially all the cards, net bankings and all the wallets.
                            
                          <br> 4. user interface - pretty decent 3.5/5 star

                          <br><br> <strong> 4. Razorpay </strong>
                          <br> 1. onboarding process - pretty easy, but they work only with the current accounts. You cannot operate with this company if you are having a saving account or you just want to test out your business.
                            
                          <br> 2. pricing - absolutely competitive 2%, 3% and no One-Time steup fee, no Annual Maintenance fee.
                            
                          <br> 3. documentation - top notch in the industry

                            They have a lot products as well - Thirdwatch, The X club, RazorpayX, Route etc.
                            
                          <br> 6. reporting - can be improved a little bit more if they can provide you some app or something like that.
                           <br><br> <strong> 5. PayUmoney </strong>
                          <br> 1. onboarding process - little bit tricky, it's gonna take probably two or three days or sometimes more to get onboarded.
                            
                          <br> 2. pricing - competitive - 2%, 3%

                          <br> 4. payment options - they provide you all the wallets, net banking, pretty much everything that you expect.
                            
                          <br> 5. user interface - pretty nice
                            
                          <br> 6. reporting - is not up to the mark, specially on the side where they put up the graphs and charts.
                            
                          <br><br> <strong>  6. instamojo </strong>
                          <br> 1. onboarding process - pretty good. You can just enter your tax information and bank details and you can be onboarded within hours.
                            
                           <br> 2. pricing - very competitive

                          <br> 6. reportings are lagging a little bit, but if they introduce more graphs, charts and visualization part that would be great. They work with the saving account and you don't need to have a checking or something just banking account.
                            
                          <br><br> <strong>  7. CashFree </strong>

                          <br><br> <strong>  8. CC Avenue </strong>
                         <br> 1. CC Avenue is one of the big dogs in the payment gateway industry. Only one is their onboarding process because they still work on the manual physical papers and you have to send the couriers and files and back and forth. So the onboarding process is pain and it might take months to get on board at there.
                            
                          <br> 2. pricing - very competitive

                            In fact a lot of blogs and articles are there to integrate in almost any tech stack.
                            
                          <br> 4. payment option - they provide you insane amount of options in the payment.
                            
                          <br> 5. user interface - okay 3/5 stars
                            
                          <br> 6. reports - pretty dope

                          <br>  It's a PayPal subsidiary company and their integration, documentation, everything is absolutely good. It mostly works with credit cards. Supports all the Visa, PayPal, Venmo, Apple pay and more over focused on the United States.
                            
                           <br><br> <strong> 10. 2checkout </strong>
                          <br> 1. Their pricing and everything is decent, very competitive. On the other hand onboarding process is little bit difficult and you will face a lot of troubles and documentation back and forth.
                            
                          <br> 2. user interface - okay 3/5 stars
                            
                          <br> 3. payment option - they provide a lot of options. But the thing which is a little bit tricky is into their products. They have 2sell, 2subscribe, 2Monetize and each of them have different pricing options and a little bit confusing.</p>
