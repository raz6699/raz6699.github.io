                            <br><strong> Introduction To Cloud </strong>

                            <br> <em> Why Cloud? </em>
                            
                            <br> <em> Before Cloud Computing </em>
                          <br> Suppose you want to host a website, these are the following things that you would need to do:
                            
                         <br>   - Buy a stack of server.
                       <br>     - High traffic? More servers.
                           <br> - Monitoring and Maintaining servers
                       <br><br>     
                            <strong> Disadvantages </strong>
                            
                           <br> - If you consider costs then this setup is expensive.
                           <br> - Troubleshooting problems can be tedious and may conflict with your business goals.
                           <br> - Since the traffic is varying, your servers will be idle most of the time.
                            
                           <br><br> Everything is going online these days: we shop online, order food online, almost every information that we need is online. That means we have a lot of data that's being generated these days and it's called digital data. Amount of data that we have is huge these days, and we need a space to maintain this data. And all of these issues taking care of by Cloud.
                            
                          <br><br> <strong> What is Cloud? </strong>
                            
                          <br>  "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
                            The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing and storage takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device. This is why a user can log in to their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone breaks and still find their old account in place, with all their photos, videos, and conversation history. It works the same way with cloud email providers like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, and with cloud storage providers like Dropbox or Google Drive.
